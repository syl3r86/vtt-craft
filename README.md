# VTT Craft

A World of Warcraft themed reskin for Foundry VTT

## Installation
1. Copy this link and use it in Foundrys Module Manager to install the Module

    > https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syl3r86/vtt-craft/master/module.json
    
2. Enable the Module in your Worlds Module Manager

3. Choose one of the 3 skins on offer in the Module Settings

## Details
This module contains 3 different styles to choose from. There is a generic style called Neutral and one for the Horde (yay) and Alliance (booooo). And even though I have a clear preference in terms of factions, both skins are as good as I'm able to make them (at the moment).
